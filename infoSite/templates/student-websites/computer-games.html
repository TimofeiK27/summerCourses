      <p style="font-size: 30px;">A sandbox game is a video game with a gameplay element that provides the player a great degree of creativity
        to interact with, usually without any predetermined goal, or alternatively with a goal that the player sets for themselves.
        Such games may lack any objective, and are sometimes referred to as non-games or software toys.</p>
      <h2 style="text-align:center">SHOTERS</h2>

      <p style="font-size: 30px;">Shooter video games or shooters are a subgenre of action video games where the focus is almost entirely
         on the defeat of the character's enemies using the weapons given to the player. Usually these weapons are
          firearms or some other long-range weapons, and can be used in combination with other tools such as grenades for indirect offense,
           armor for additional defense, or accessories such as telescopic sights to modify the behavior of the weapons.</p>
        <h2 style="text-align:center">PUZZLERS AND PARTY GAMES</h2>
        <img style="border: 2px white double; width: 100%;" src="https://static1.thegamerimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Steam-Puzzle-Games-Featured-Image.jpg" alt="">
        <p style="font-size: 30px;">Puzzle video games owe their origins to brain teasers and puzzles throughout human history.
            The mathematical strategy game Nim, and other traditional, thinking games, such as Hangman and Bulls and Cows (commercialized as Mastermind),
             were popular targets for computer implementation.</p>
